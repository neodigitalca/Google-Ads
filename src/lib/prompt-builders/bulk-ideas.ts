- Forward-looking topics: use ${year} or ${year + 1}. Do not use ${year - 1} or earlier unless the topic is explicitly historical.
- MetaDescription and Rationale: no stale years, expired deadlines, or outdated "just announced" / "new for last year" framing.
- Keywords stay short-tail; do not embed outdated years in Keyword unless the query intent requires a specific historical year.
- Seasonal or time-sensitive angles must fit the season/month of today's date when relevant.
- Do not invent calendar dates inside checklist fields; when a year is needed, derive it from today's date above.

- **MetaDescription:** local SEO with place plus primary service; no double-quote characters inside the value.
- **Modifier:** leave **empty** for every row (entity landing URLs). On each checklist line use **Modifier: ""** (empty quotes). Do not output guide, comparison, geo-landing, or any other modifier text.
