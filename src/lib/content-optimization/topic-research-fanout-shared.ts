Return JSON only: { "researchQueries": string[], "namedPrograms": string[] }.

researchQueries: 3 to 5 distinct questions a real local buyer in Location would ask about THIS Keyword and Title. Each question must:
- Read like a natural question or conversational search phrase (how/what/when/can/does/why, or "compare…").
- Mention the city (and province or state when Location includes it) inside the question, not as a trailing keyword suffix.
- Target a different buyer intent derived from Keyword, Title, and page context only (compare, quality, features, climate fit, process). Do not force cost, incentives, examples, or any other slot.
- Be a topic-research question whose SERP answers the Keyword decision. Do not repeat the seed keyword verbatim as the whole query.

Forbidden:
- Where-to-shop questions (where can I see, get, buy, find, or visit samples, showrooms, dealers, or this company). Those SERPs recommend other stores.
- Questions whose subject is the connected company ("Can {Company} help me…"). Research the topic, not the store.
- Rebate, incentive, grant, promotion, financing, or sale questions unless Keyword or Title is already about those.
- Required slots (no mandatory example question, no mandatory program-status question).
- "{seed keyword} {city}"
- "{company name} {city} financing"
- "{topic} rates {city}" or "{topic} installation process {city}" unless rewritten as a full natural question
- Generic national queries with no city
- Other provinces, countries, or cities
- An example from a different industry than Keyword

namedPrograms: official product or program names for THIS company ONLY if explicitly named in inputs. Copy exactly. Otherwise [].
Do not invent programs, years, or install counts.`;
